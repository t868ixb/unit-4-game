# unit-4-game

Welcome to the word guessig game.  I hope you enjoy it.

The html file is using bootstrap.  However, it does not contain much of the power available with bootstrap.  I used it mostly for helping to layout the rows and columns.  

The javascript file contains the bulk of the power behind the game.  To be honest, I find it hard to remember what's javascript vs jQuery.  I know for sure I have some jQuery in there since it's a bit easier than figuring things out with pure javascript.

As for the CSS file, I admit that I'm repeating a lot fo code.  With more experience I want to focus on reducing that.
